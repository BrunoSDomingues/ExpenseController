# Expense Controller
A Kotlin app to view and edit expenses for each day

## Goal
The goal of this application is to serve as a better way to control and view your expenses. There are many apps currently available that do this (including my bank app), but to me they are either too confusing or too expensive, so, I decided to make my own.

## Current Functionalities
At the moment, the application has the following functionalities:

1. View total expenses count
2. View expense by ID

## Future functionalities
I will be updating this project to add new functionalities. For now, these are the guaranteed future functionalities. This list is subject to changes.

1. Add an expense
2. View expenses of a single day
3. View all expenses of all days
4. View all days and the sum of the expenses per day
5. View monthly sum
6. View daily average for a month
7. View the most expensive day in a month
8. View the highest expense in a month
9. Add categories
10. Custom categories
